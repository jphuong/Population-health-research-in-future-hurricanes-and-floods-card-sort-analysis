# Analysis of card sorts

This repository provides the codebase and source data matrices that summarize 15 card sorting sessions. These card sorting sessions were conducted as part of a study that focused on population health researcher information needs and use-cases to consider for Hurricane and floods disaster preparedness. The card sort use-cases inform the design of research tools and preparedness to address population health concerns for anticipated hurricanes and floods.

The card sort analysis Jupyter notebook documents the exploratory analyses applied to analyze the perceived information usefulness ratings (i.e., "useful", "maybe useful", and "not useful"). The analysis performed here represent the descriptive statistics and cluster analysis initially prescribed during the planning phase of the study.
